# Working on the Front End:

Run `npm start` and edit files as usual.

# Working on the Back End:

Run `npm run-script build` first to build the React App. Then run `node server.js`
to start the server.

# IMPORTANT:

The server and react dev server run on different port. If you want to run both
at the same time, you will need to edit the port number in `server.js`
